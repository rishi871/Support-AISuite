# requirements.txt

# --- Core Application Framework ---
gradio               # UI Framework used in app.py

# --- Environment Variables ---
python-dotenv        # For loading .env files (like GOOGLE_API_KEY, PHOENIX_API_KEY)

# --- LangChain & LLM Integration ---
langchain            # Core LangChain library
langchain-community  # Community integrations (loaders, vectorstores, etc.)
langchain-google-genai # Integration with Google Generative AI models (Gemini)
langchainhub         # For pulling prompts and other LangChain objects (e.g., react-chat agent prompt)
google-generativeai  # Underlying SDK for Google AI

# --- Vector Store ---
chromadb             # Vector database used for storing code embeddings

# --- Observability & Tracing ---
openinference-instrumentation-langchain # Arize Phoenix for tracing/observability, includes OpenTelemetry SDK & Langchain integration

# --- Utilities & Dependencies ---
tiktoken             # Tokenizer often used by LangChain for text splitting/counting
chardet              # Character encoding detection, used by TextLoader

# --- Notes ---
# - Removed 'streamlit' as the provided app.py uses Gradio.
# - Consider pinning specific versions (e.g., langchain==0.1.16) for better reproducibility
#   once you have a stable working environment. Example: pip freeze > requirements.txt
